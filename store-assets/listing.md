## Description

✨ **LUMINA - Your AI Study Buddy That Actually Helps You Learn**

Ever wish you had a tutor who helps you figure things out instead of just telling you the answer? That's Lumina!

**How Lumina is Different:**
Unlike other AI tools, Lumina uses the Socratic method — asking guiding questions that lead you to discover answers yourself. This is how real learning happens!

**Perfect For:**
• Essay writing - brainstorm ideas, organize thoughts, strengthen arguments
• Math homework - understand concepts, not just get solutions
• Science problems - break down complex topics step by step
• Reading comprehension - dig deeper into texts
• Any subject where you're stuck!

**Features:**
✓ Opens as a sidebar on any webpage
✓ Highlight text and right-click to ask about it
✓ Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+L
✓ Dark mode support
✓ Works offline with your saved context

**Example:**
You: "How do I solve 2x + 5 = 13?"
Lumina: "Good equation! Our goal is to get x alone. Looking at the left side, what's 'in the way' of x being by itself?"

**Privacy First:**
• No data stored permanently
• No tracking or analytics
• Conversations are private

**Getting Started:**
1. Install Lumina
